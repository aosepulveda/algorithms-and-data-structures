# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository has examples about differents algorithms and data structures.

## Data Structures

### Arrays

#### Big-O Algorithm Complexity

| Static |      |
| ------ | ---- |
| lookup | O(1) |
| push   | O(1) |
| insert | O(n) |
| delete | O(n) |


| Dynamic |                     |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| lookup  | O(1)                |
| append  | O(1) -> can be O(n) |
| insert  | O(n)                |
| delete  | O(n)                |

#### Pros - Cons

| Pros          | Cons                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| fast lookups  | slow insert                      |
| fast push/pop | slow deletes                     |
| data ordered  | it has fixed size (static array) |

### Run examples

```bash
node data-structures/arrays.js
```
